Generate a unique and unpredictable image prompt describing one coherent visual scene. The prompt must include: 

• a clear subject or action 
• specific visual details such as colors, textures, and environment 
• artistic style or medium 
• lighting description 
• atmosphere or emotional tone 
• optional perspective or camera angle

The scene must be highly imaginative and varied. Avoid generic settings. Include enough detail for an image generator to produce a precise and recognizable result. 
The prompt should be one paragraph, between 2 and 4 sentences. Output only the finalized image prompt with no explanations or formatting.
